# particle-photon-P5-example
This example makes art from photoresistor data, collected by the particle photon. The particle photon must be up and running and connected to wifi. 
Build the "Read your Photoresistor: Function and Variable" project from the Particle website and make sure it is working. 
Once that's working, you are ready to make art using the photoresistor reading in P5.js.
